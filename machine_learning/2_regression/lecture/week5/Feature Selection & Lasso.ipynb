And to do this, we're first gonna start by describing a way to explicitly search over all possible models.

    "One is for efficiency. So let's say you have a problem which has 100 billion features. That might sound like a lot. It is actually a lot, but there are many applications out there these days where we're faced with this many features. Well, every time we go to do prediction with 100 billion features, that multiplication we have to do between our feature vector and the weights on all these features is really computationally intensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if we assume that the weights on our features are sparse, and what I mean by that is that there are many zeros, then things can be done much more efficiently. Because when we're going to form our prediction, all we need to do is sum over all of the features whose weights are not zero.\n",
    "\n",

So when we went to take the scan of your brain, you're shown either a word, or an image, or something like this. And we wanna be able to predict how you felt about that just from your brain scan. So we talked about the fact that we treat our inputs, our features, as just the voxels. We can think of them as just pixels in this image, and wanted to relate those pixel intensities to this output, this response of happiness.

    "So, our goal here is to minimize some function g. So, this is the same objective that we have whether we are talking about our closed form solution, gradient descent, or this coordinate descent algorithm. But, let me just be very explicit, where. We're saying we wanna minimize over all possible w some g(w), where here, we're assuming g(w) is function of multiple variables. Let's call it g(w0,w1,...,wD). And often, minimizing over a large set of variables can be a very challenging problem. But in contrast,\n",
    "often it's possible to think about optimizing just a single dimension, keeping all of the other dimensions fixed. So easy for each coordinate when keeping others fixed, because that turns into just a 1D optimization problem. \n",

    "And so, that's the motivation behind coordinate decent, where the coordinate descent algorithm, it's really intuitive. We're just gonna start by initializing our w vector, which will denote $\\hat w = 0$. Or you could use some smarter initialization, if you have it. And then while the algorithm's not converged, we're just gonna pick a coordinate out of 0, 1 all the way to d. And we're gonna set $\\hat w_j$ equal to the w that minimizes. I'm gonna write this as an omega, so I'm gonna search over all possible values of omega that minimizes g of $(\\hat w_0, ..., \\hat w_{j-1}, \\omega, \\hat w_{j+1}, \\hat w_D)$.\n",

I'm next gonna look at keeping W1 fixed and optimizing over W0, and here was the minimum, I'm gonna drop down to the minimum which is here and I'm gonna optimize over W1 holding W0 fixed to this value.

    "Well, our presentation of coordinate ascent for lasso is really simplified if we think about normalizing our features and this is also a practically important concept. So let's take a few minutes to discuss this idea of normalizing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well when we talk about normalizing our features what we're talking about is taking a column of our training data, so very important that we take a column not a row. Okay. So I'll say it once more. We take a column not a row because what does a column represent? Well, for example in our housing application it might represent, all instances of the number of square feet of houses in our training data set. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do an operation on square feet. That would be one column.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if I took a row we're gonna be doing an operation for a specific observation and that operation would be different between different observations and things would be all on different scales between our different observations and that wouldn't make any sense. So please never do that. Please do this observation on columns of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's this operation we're gonna do? Well we're gonna take our column, our specific feature like square feet over our n different observations in our training set, and we're going to normalize each of these entries, each of these feature values by the following quantity, and doing this operation is gonna place each one of our features into the same numeric range, because the range of values we might see for square feet versus number of floors or number of bathrooms is dramatically different. After we do this transformation though, everything will be in the same numeric range, so that's why it's a practically important transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, I wanna emphasize one thing that when you transform your features, when you normalize them. In this way or any way that you choose to transform your features on your training dataset you have to do exactly the same operation on your test dataset. Otherwise you're gonna be mixing up the apples and oranges because for example, you think about transforming your training data from Measuring square feet to measuring square meters for every house but then your test data is still in square feet. When I learn a model in my training data, which is now in square meters, and I go to test it on my test data which is square feet, it's gonna give me bogus answers. Okay, so make sure you do the same operation on both training and test and so, if we're gonna to call this normalizer, which we'll use this notation later, Zj, we're going to divide by exactly the same quantity for each column of our test set. So this same Zj appears here where, just to emphasize, we're summing over all of our training data points in doing this operation here, and we're applying it to one of our test data points."

    "\n",
    "But now what does our least squares line look like? Well again, we can just set $\\lambda = 0$, and we see that this least squares line $\\hat w_j^{LS} = \\frac{\\rho_j}{z_j}$. \n",
    "- Remember $z_j$ is that normalizer summing over the square of all of our features. So, that number will be positive and it's typically gonna be larger than one. Potentially much larger than one. So, relative to a slope, which is a 45 degree angle slope of 1, I'm saying that this line is shrunk more this way, typically, in the case of unnormalized features.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, when I look at my lasso solution, $\\hat w^{lasso}$. In the range $[-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}, \\frac{\\lambda}{2}]$, I get this thresholding of the coefficients exactly to zero, relative to my least square solution. And outside that range, the difference between the least square solution and my lasso solution, is that my coefficients are each shrunk by an amount $\\frac{\\lambda}{2z_j}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But remember that $rho_j$ here as compared to when we talked about normalized features was defined differently. It was defined in terms of our unnormalized features. So, for the same value of lambda that you would use with normalized features you're getting a different relationship here. A different range where things are set to zero. "

    "So let's just conclude by discussing a few practical issues with lasso. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the fact that, as we've seen in multiple different ways throughout this module, lasso shrinks the coefficients relative to the least square solution. So what it's doing is increasing the bias of the solution in exchange for having lower variance. So this is doing this automatic bias variance tradeoff but we might wanna still have a low bias solution, so we can actually think about reducing the bias of our solution in the following way. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is called debiasing the lasso solution, where we run our lasso solver and we get out a set of selected features, so those are the features whose weights were not set exactly to zero, and then what we do is we take that reduced model. The model with these selected features and we run just standard lease squares regression on that reduced model. And in this case, what happens is these features that were deemed relevant to our task, their weights after doing this debiasing procedure will not be shrunk,\n",
    "relative to the weights of a least square solution if we had started exactly with that reduced model. But, of course, that was the whole point, we didn't know which model, so the lasso is allowing us to choose out this model, and then just run least squares on that model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So these plots show a little illustration of the benefits of debiasing. So the top figure shows the true coefficients for data, so it's generated with 4,096 different coefficients or different features in the model, but only 160 of these had positive coefficients associated with them. So it's a very sparse setup and if you look at the L1 reconstruction, that's the second row of this plot, you see that it's discovered 1,024 features that have non zero weights, has mean squared error of 0.0072, but if you take those 1,024 non zero weight features and just run least squares regression on them, you get the third row. And that has significantly, significantly, lower mean square but in contrast, how do you run least squares on the full model with 4,096 features? You would get a really, really poor estimate of all that's going on and a very large mean square there. So this shows the importance of doing both lasso and possibly this debiasing on top of that. "

    "Another issue with lasso is, if you have a collection of strongly correlated features, lasso will tend to just select amongst them pretty much arbitrarily. And what I mean is that, a small tweak in the data might lead to one variable included, whereas a different tweak of the data would have a different one of these variables included. So we're now housing an application. Maybe you could imagine that square feet and lot size are very correlated, and we might just arbitrarily choose between these, but in a lot of cases, you actually wanna include the whole set of correlated variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "And another issue is the fact that, it's been shown empirically that in many cases, rich regression actually outperforms lasso in terms of predictive performance. So there are other variants of lasso, something called elastic net. That tries to address these set of issues. And what it does is, it fuses both the objectives of ridge and lasso, including both an L1 and an L2 penalty. And you can see this paper for further discussion of these and other issues with the original lasso objective, and how elastic net addresses it. "

    "In summary, we've really learned a lot this module. We've thought about this task of feature selection and we've described ways searching over first, all possible sets of features that we might want to include to come up with the best model. Talked about the challenges of that computationally, and then we turned to thinking about greedy algorithms and then discuss these radialized regression approach of lasso for addressing the feature selection task. So really it's covering a lot of ground. That's really important concepts in machine learning. And this lasso regularized regression approach, although really, really simple, has dramatically transformed the field of machine learning statistics and engineering. It's shown its utility in a variety of different applied domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I wanna mention a really important issue, which we kind of alluded to, which is that for feature selection, not just lasso, but in general when you're thinking about feature selection, you have to be really careful about interpreting the features that you selected. And some reasons for this include the fact that the features you selected are always just in the context of what you provided as the set of possible features to choose from to begin with. And likewise, the set of selected features are really sensitive to correlations between features and, in those cases, small changes in the data can lead to different features being included, too. So to say that one feature is important and the other isn't, you have to be careful with statements like that. And also of course, the set of selective features depends on which algorithm you use. We especially saw this when we talked about those greedy algorithms, like the forward stepwise procedure. But I did want to mention that there are some nice theoretical guarantees for lasso under very specific conditions. "
